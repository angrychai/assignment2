9 commits.
Found using "git shortlog" and adding the commits by user together.
6 by Esteban Parra plus 3 by Wyatt Wood makes 9

3.
Couldn't find a method under Git itself to find this direct information, it appears
git doesn't record that information in the repository, only last time committed.

One thing branches are used for is to allow for new features or changes to be
implemented and debugged without causing problems in the main program during
their development.
Branches can also be used to allow for specific developers or groups of
developers to split up a project and work on specific bugs or aspects of it in
parallel without another's work interfering with theirs during that time.

5.
git log shows the sequence of commits including commit hash, author, date, and
commit message.
git status shows status of the local repository vs the remote repository and
status of tracked and untracked files.

6.
git log Vehicle.h

7.
git log --grep='file'

Inheritance refers to the ability of an inheriting class to access the
public and protected data and methods of the class it is inheriting from.
Polymorphism refers to the ability for descendant classes to be cast as
any of the classes in their parent hierarchy. If Car inherits from Vehicle,
Car can be cast as a Vehicle object, too.
Encapsulation refers to the ability for a class to protect its data by only
allowing its modification via the public interface of the class itsef.

The main difference is that in the Integration manager workflow the person
who maintains the blessed code directly interfaces with the developer while
in the dictator and lieutenants workflow there is more stratification, with
developers instead working with one of many lieutenants who in turn will
have their code pulled and integrated by the dictator after the lieutenant
has done their own integration of multiple developer's work. Dictator and
Lieutenants is more often used for very large projects like the Linux kernel.

10.
A team of 100 developers would benefit from the dictator and lieutenants
model by being able to continue their work from their own repository while
a lieutenant handles integration with other developers in their own
repository before that work is integrated by a dictator. Dealing with
changes from 99 other developers on a regular basis would cause more
work than centralizing that work with lieutenants and dictators.
